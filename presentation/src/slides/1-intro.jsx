  I'm a Software Engineer at SEL were I work on applications for manufacturing. This is an area 
  that really benefits from the talk I'm doing today. The systems we build are dynamic, and have to work
  even when there is no internet. In this area, functional programming helps immensely. 
  <br />
  <br />
  At SEL we design and build products that protect power grids around the world.
  <br />
  Our mission is to make Electric Power Safer, More Reliable, and More EconomicalÂ®
  <br />

  tools to solve problems.
